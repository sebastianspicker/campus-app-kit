# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security reports. 

## Scope

This public repo is a template. It intentionally contains only public data sources and stubs.
Private integrations and operational systems are out of scope and must live in a private repo.

## No Secrets in This Repo

Do not commit API keys, tokens, passwords, certificates, or private endpoints.
Use environment variables and secret stores in private infrastructure instead.

## Coordinated Disclosure

If you are unsure whether something is a vulnerability, contact us privately.
We will work with you to validate and resolve issues responsibly.
