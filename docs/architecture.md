# Architecture

This repo ships a public Campus App template with a small BFF (backend-for-frontend). The BFF exposes only public data sources and stubbed connectors.

## Why a BFF

- Shield the app from scraping logic and rate limits.
- Normalize data into a shared domain model.
- Keep sensitive connectors out of the public repo.

## Core pieces

- **Mobile app** – Expo + Expo Router (tabs, events, rooms, schedule).
- **BFF** – Public connectors + private stubs; rate limiting, caching, CORS.
- **Shared** – Domain types and Zod schemas (`packages/shared`).
- **Institution packs** – Public data only (`packages/institutions`).

## Public vs private

    Packs[Institution packs]
    Stubs[Private stubs]
  end
  subgraph PrivateRepo["Private repo (fork)"]
    RealConn[Real connectors]
    SSO[SSO/OIDC]
    PrivateAPI[Private APIs]
  end
  PublicConn --> Packs

  RealConn --> SSO
  RealConn --> PrivateAPI
```

| In this repo | In a private fork |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Public website / ICS data | Real connectors (SSO, sessions, scraping) |
| Institution packs (public info only) | Private endpoints and ops |
| Interfaces and stubs for private connectors | Caching, rate limits, monitoring |

## Data flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant App as Mobile app
  participant BFF as BFF
  participant Conn as Connectors
  participant Ext as External sources

  App->>BFF: GET /today or /events
  BFF->>BFF: Load institution pack
  BFF->>Conn: fetchPublicEvents / fetchPublicSchedule
  Conn->>Ext: HTTP (websites, ICS)
  Ext-->>Conn: HTML / ICS
  Conn-->>BFF: Normalized events/schedule
  BFF-->>App: JSON (Cache-Control, optional _degraded)
  App->>App: Render + brief client cache
```

1. Mobile app requests `/today` or `/events` (or `/rooms`, `/schedule`) from the BFF.
2. BFF reads the institution pack and calls public connectors.
3. Responses are normalized into shared domain models (Zod-validated).
4. Mobile app renders the data and caches briefly (e.g. `getCachedJson`).
