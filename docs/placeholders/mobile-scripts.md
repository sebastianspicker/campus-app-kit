# Placeholder: `apps/mobile` Scripts/Commands

**Why this is missing**
- `start`/`dev` in `apps/mobile/package.json` were placeholders and did not describe a real dev workflow.

**TODO**
- `start` should run `expo start`, `dev` can run `expo start --dev-client` when needed.
- Add scripts for `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, and EAS `build`.
- Document the commands in README/runbook.
