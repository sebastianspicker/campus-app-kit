# Placeholder: Documentation & runbook

**Why this is missing**
- The README is currently brief and does not contain full run/deploy instructions for mobile/BFF/env.

**TODO**
- Add concrete commands for `@campus/mobile` (start/dev/build) and `@campus/bff` (dev/docker).
- Add a configuration matrix (BFF URL, `INSTITUTION_ID`, dev vs production).
- Add deployment notes for BFF containers and EAS builds.
