# Placeholder: `@campus/ui` & `@campus/institutions`

**Why this is missing**
- These packages are effectively empty and unused, which makes the template look unfinished.

**TODO**
- Either implement meaningful content and use it in the app/BFF, or remove the packages from the workspace.
- If kept, ensure they build (`tsc`) and do not break `pnpm build`.
