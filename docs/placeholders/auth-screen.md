# Demo authentication screen

This public template does not include real authentication (private connectors and auth live in a private repo).

The `/auth/login` screen should communicate clearly:

- It is a demo UX placeholder.
- The primary action should either route into a guest/demo flow or be visibly disabled with an explanation.
- It must not imply that real accounts exist in this public repo.
