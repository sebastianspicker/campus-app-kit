## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

# Start BFF and mobile in parallel
INSTITUTION_ID=hfmt pnpm dev
```

Then open the mobile app with Expo Go or a dev client.

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 20, pnpm 9. See [Runbook](docs/runbook.md) for detailed setup.

## Features

- **Mobile app** – Expo SDK 51 with Expo Router; Today, Events, Rooms, Schedule screens
- **BFF** – Optional Node.js API with public connectors, rate limiting, HTTP caching, CORS
- **Institution packs** – Public config per institution; easy to add more
- **Shared types** – Zod schemas used by both BFF and mobile
